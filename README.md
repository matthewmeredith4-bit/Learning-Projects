Automated Horizon Scanning Tool

In the fast-moving Pharmaceutical industry, missing a competitor's regulatory update or a new clinical trial result can result in lost strategic opportunities. 

I built this tool to automate the manual process of horizon scanning. Instead of manually checking multiple websites daily, this Python application aggregates, filters, and logs critical market intelligence automatically. It is designed to support market access teams by tracking high priority assets (e.g., SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists).
